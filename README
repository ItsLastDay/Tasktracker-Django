Academic project, written for course "Building web-applications" (feb 2014 - apr 2014)
Each student was obliged to:  
1. Draw a concept of each page of website.  
2. Design a relational database schema, suitable for purposes.  
3. Implement a functioning web-application.  

The result was a simple website about tasktracking, powered by Django + nginx + gunicorn.   
Users were allowed to:  
-register  
-post a 'task', link other users to it  
-view and filter tasks (e.g. by tag, by name)
